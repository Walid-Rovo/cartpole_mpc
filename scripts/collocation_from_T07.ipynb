    "So far we have seen how to approximate an ODE solution\n",
    "with Lagrange polynomials **given a set of values from the solution**.\n",
    "This may seem confusing because we are looking for these values in the first place.\n",
    "However, it still helps us because we can now state conditions based on this polynomial representation\n",
    "that **must hold for the desired solution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left.\\frac{d x^K_i}{dt}\\right|_{t_{i,k}} = f(x_{i,k}), \\quad k=1,\\dots,K.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the time derivatives from our polynomial approximation evaluated\n",
    "**at the collocation points** must be equal to the original ODE at these same points.\n",
    "**Note** that we excluded the collocation point $\\tau_0=0$, which is treated seperately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we assumed a polynomial structure of $x^K_i(t)$ the time derivative can be conveniently expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left.\\frac{d x^K_i}{dt}\\right|_{t_{i,k}} = \\sum_{j=0}^K \\frac{x_{i,j}}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "    \\underbrace{\\left.\\frac{d L_j}{d \\tau}\\right|_{\\tau_k}}_{a_{j,k}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for which we substituted $t$ with $\\tau$ (dimensionless time between 0 and 1).\n",
    "It is important to notice that **for fixed collocation points** the terms $a_{j,k}$\n",
    "**are constants that can be pre-computed.**\n",
    "The choice of these points is significant and will be discussed later in this notebook.\n",

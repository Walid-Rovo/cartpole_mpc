    "\n",
    "So far we have seen how to approximate an ODE solution\n",
    "with Lagrange polynomials **given a set of values from the solution**.\n",
    "This may seem confusing because we are looking for these values in the first place./\n",
    "However, it still helps us because we can now state conditions based on this polynomial representation\n",
    "that **must hold for the desired solution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left.\\frac{d x^K_i}{dt}\\right|_{t_{i,k}} = f(x_{i,k}), \\quad k=1,\\dots,K.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the time derivatives from our polynomial approximation evaluated\n",
    "**at the collocation points** must be equal to the original ODE at these same points.\n",
    "**Note** that we excluded the collocation point $\\tau_0=0$, which is treated seperately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we assumed a polynomial structure of $x^K_i(t)$ the time derivative can be conveniently expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left.\\frac{d x^K_i}{dt}\\right|_{t_{i,k}} = \\sum_{j=0}^K \\frac{x_{i,j}}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "    \\underbrace{\\left.\\frac{d L_j}{d \\tau}\\right|_{\\tau_k}}_{a_{j,k}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for which we substituted $t$ with $\\tau$ (dimensionless time between 0 and 1).\n",
    "It is important to notice that **for fixed collocation points** the terms $a_{j,k}$\n",
    "**are constants that can be pre-computed.**\n",
    "The choice of these points is significant and will be discussed later in this notebook.\n",

    "Based on Lagrange polynomials we will now introduce orthogonal collaction and use it to solve an ODE.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have seen how to approximate an ODE solution\n",
    "with Lagrange polynomials **given a set of values from the solution**.\n",
    "This may seem confusing because we are looking for these values in the first place.\n",
    "However, it still helps us because we can now state conditions based on this polynomial representation\n",
    "that **must hold for the desired solution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left.\\frac{d x^K_i}{dt}\\right|_{t_{i,k}} = f(x_{i,k}), \\quad k=1,\\dots,K.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the time derivatives from our polynomial approximation evaluated\n",
    "**at the collocation points** must be equal to the original ODE at these same points.\n",
    "**Note** that we excluded the collocation point $\\tau_0=0$, which is treated seperately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we assumed a polynomial structure of $x^K_i(t)$ the time derivative can be conveniently expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left.\\frac{d x^K_i}{dt}\\right|_{t_{i,k}} = \\sum_{j=0}^K \\frac{x_{i,j}}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "    \\underbrace{\\left.\\frac{d L_j}{d \\tau}\\right|_{\\tau_k}}_{a_{j,k}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for which we substituted $t$ with $\\tau$ (dimensionless time between 0 and 1).\n",
    "It is important to notice that **for fixed collocation points** the terms $a_{j,k}$\n",
    "**are constants that can be pre-computed.**\n",
    "The choice of these points is significant and will be discussed later in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collocation constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution of the ODE, i.e. the values of $x_{i,j}$ are now obtained by solving\n",
    "the set of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{j=0}^K a_{j,k} \\frac{x_{i,j}}{\\Delta t} = f(x_{i,k}), \\quad k=1,\\dots,K.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collocation with orthogonal polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we used Lagrange polynomials to interpolate on arbitrary **collocation** points. \n",
    "To solve an ODE, it shows that certain **collocation** points are better than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Favorable properties are obtained when choosing the collocation points as the roots of a $K$-th degree **Gauss-Jacobi** polynomial:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_0^1 (1-\\tau)^{\\alpha} \\tau^{\\beta} P_i(\\tau) P_{j}(\\tau) = 0, \\quad i=0,\\dots, K-1,\\ j=1,\\dots, K\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is a general class of **orthogonal polynomials**. Specific cases of this polynomial are obtained for $\\alpha=0,\\ \\beta=0$ (**Legrende polynomial**) and for $\\alpha=1,\\ \\beta=0$ (**Radau**) polynomial. \n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want to discuss here, why these collocation points are favorable or how to compute them. In practize we can just obtain the values from tables and fortunately they are also available from CasADi:"
